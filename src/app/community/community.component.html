            <p>Just had my laptop resurrected and the engineer was fantastic. Very patient, very knowledgeable and knew
                exactly what he was doing. If I ever have another computer problem, I'll definitely give these guys a
                call. They are professionals and they have great customer service. Great price, great job, thanks a lot!

            <p>My friend recommended Repair & Fix to me when I had some issues with my laptop. I contacted them and they
                were very understanding, helpful and prompt with dealing with my requirements. Your consultants were
                happy to talk me through everything during the first consultation. Thank you!</p>

            <p>I have worked with Repair & Fix for several years. They re-built a computer for me and later upgraded it
                and now it feels just like a new one. The value, quality, and follow-up are outstanding. I highly
                recommend this company, their professionalism and customer care are unmatched.</p>
